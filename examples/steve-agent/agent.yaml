  Job hunting assistant. Send it a message describing what you need help with:
  building or tailoring a resume, writing a cover letter, tracking job applications,
  or scouting openings at specific companies. It maintains a persistent profile
  of the user's work history, skills, and education across sessions. On first use,
  ask it to import an existing resume or build a profile from scratch. On subsequent
  uses, just describe the task (e.g. "tailor my resume for this Senior Engineer role
  at Google" or "find backend roles at Stripe"). It stores all data in its workspace
  under /memories/.
